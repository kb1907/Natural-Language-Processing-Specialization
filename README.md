## WHAT  I LEARNED
--------------------------------------

- Use logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies & translate words.

- Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to implement autocorrect, autocomplete & identify part-of-speech tags for words.

- Use recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs & Siamese networks in Trax for sentiment analysis, text generation & named entity recognition.

- Use encoder-decoder, causal, & self-attention to machine translate complete sentences, summarize text, build chatbots & question-answering.

## There are 4 Courses in this Specialization
--------------------------------------------------

## [Course 1 Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces](https://github.com/kb1907/Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization/tree/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Classification%20and%20Vector%20Spaces)

- [In the first course of the Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp?specialization=natural-language-processing)

a) I performed sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then na√Øve Bayes, 
b) I used vector space models to discover relationships between words and used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and
c) I wrote a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality-sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.
