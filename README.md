### WHAT  I LEARNED

- Use logistic regression, naÃ¯ve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies & translate words.

- Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to implement autocorrect, autocomplete & identify part-of-speech tags for words.

- Use recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs & Siamese networks in Trax for sentiment analysis, text generation & named entity recognition.

- Use encoder-decoder, causal, & self-attention to machine translate complete sentences, summarize text, build chatbots & question-answering.
